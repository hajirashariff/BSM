- Integration (Indigo) - External system connections

### 5. Execution Monitoring Component (`05_Execution_Monitoring_Component.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Real-time monitoring of workflow executions
**Features**:
- 4 KPI cards (Total, Running, Completed, Failed executions)
- Execution table with status, progress, duration
- Real-time execution logs
- Execution details modal
- Filtering and search capabilities

**Execution Statuses**:
- Running (Blue) - Currently executing
- Completed (Green) - Successfully finished
- Failed (Red) - Execution failed
- Paused (Yellow) - Temporarily stopped
- Cancelled (Gray) - Manually cancelled

## üé® Design Patterns Used

### 1. Component Composition
- Each component is self-contained with its own state management
- Props-based communication between components
- Reusable UI patterns (cards, buttons, tables)

### 2. State Management
- Local state using React hooks (`useState`)
- Filtered data computed from base data arrays
- Modal state management for detailed views

### 3. UI/UX Patterns
- Consistent card-based layout
- Color-coded status indicators
- Icon-based visual hierarchy
- Responsive grid layouts
- Hover effects and transitions

### 4. Data Flow
- Mock data arrays for demonstration
- Computed metrics from base data
- Real-time filtering and search
- Dynamic content rendering

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- React 18+ with hooks
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

### Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive grids
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering and rendering
- **Extensibility**: Modular component structure

### Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Consistent color palette
- Responsive breakpoints
- Component-specific styling

## üìä Mock Data Structure

### Workflow Object
```typescript
interface Workflow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'Active' | 'Draft' | 'Paused' | 'Error';
  category: string;
  steps: number;
  avgDuration: string;
  successRate: number;
  lastRun: string;
  nextRun: string;
  triggers: string[];
  actions: string[];
  owner: string;
  created: string;
  runs: number;
  tags: string[];
  template: boolean;
  // Additional properties for dashboard
  version: string;
  lastModified: string;
  workspace: string;
  priority: string;
  health: string;
  cost: string;
  executionTime: string;
  failureCount: number;
  lastFailure: string;
  permissions: {
    view: string[];
    edit: string[];
    execute: string[];
  };
}
```

### AI Feature Object
```typescript
interface AIFeature {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'Active' | 'Beta' | 'Inactive';
  accuracy: number;
  usage: number;
  category: string;
  icon: React.ComponentType;
  color: string;
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### 1. Installation
```bash
npm install react lucide-react
npm install -D tailwindcss @types/react
```

### 2. Integration
```typescript
// Import the main workflow page
import WorkflowsPage from './01_Main_Workflow_Page';

// Use in your app
<WorkflowsPage />
```

### 3. Customization
- Modify mock data arrays to match your data structure
- Update color schemes in status/priority/health color objects
- Add new node types in the workflow builder
- Extend AI features as needed

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live execution monitoring
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Charts and graphs for workflow performance
3. **Template Library**: Pre-built workflow templates
4. **Version Control**: Workflow versioning and rollback
5. **Collaboration**: Multi-user workflow editing
6. **API Integration**: Real backend API connections
7. **Mobile App**: React Native mobile interface
8. **Advanced AI**: Machine learning workflow optimization

### Technical Improvements
1. **State Management**: Redux or Zustand for complex state
2. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests
3. **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large datasets
4. **Accessibility**: Enhanced ARIA support
5. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support

## üìù Notes

- All components use mock data for demonstration purposes
- Icons are from Lucide React library
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Components are designed to be easily integrated into existing React applications
- All interactive elements have proper hover states and transitions
- The code follows React best practices and modern patterns

## ü§ù Contributing

When extending these components:
1. Maintain consistent naming conventions
2. Follow the established color scheme
3. Use TypeScript for type safety
4. Add proper error handling
5. Include accessibility features
6. Write comprehensive documentation
7. Test thoroughly before deployment
